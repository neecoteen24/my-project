Live Character Counter – Description

HTML

Defines the layout: a heading, a textarea for input, and a paragraph to display the character count.

Textarea has a placeholder "Start typing..." and starts empty.

Character counter is initially displayed as "Characters: 0".


CSS

Sets background to light gray and uses a clean sans-serif font.

Centers the container with padding, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow.

Styles the textarea with width 90%, height 150px, padding, border, and vertical resizing.

Styles the counter text with spacing, medium font size, and dark gray color.


JavaScript (Main Logic)

Selects the textarea and character counter elements using getElementById().

Adds an input event listener to the textarea:

Triggered whenever the user types, deletes, or pastes text.


Inside the event:

Gets the current length of the text inside the textarea (.value.length).

Updates the counter’s text (.textContent) to show "Characters: X", where X is the current length.


This ensures the counter is always in sync with user input in real time.


Functionality

Typing increases the counter.

Deleting decreases the counter.

Clearing the textarea resets the counter to 0.


Learning Outcomes

DOM manipulation with getElementById().

Real-time updates using the input event.

Dynamically changing content with .textContent.

Integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactivity.
