Experiment 3 – Creating an Admin Dashboard with Light/Dark Mode Toggle

I worked on building a simple and clean Admin Dashboard layout using HTML and CSS, with a functional light/dark mode toggle.

What’s in the UI?

A header that displays “Admin Dashboard” on the far left and a Dark Mode toggle label on the far right.

A navigation sidebar on the left with links for Home, Users, and Settings.

A main content area that welcomes the admin and serves as a placeholder for charts, tables, or reports.

A footer at the bottom displaying copyright.

A light/dark theme toggle that changes the background and text colors across the whole layout using CSS variables.

What procedures I have taken?

Created an index.html file with a dashboard container divided into three main sections using CSS Grid:

Header – contains the title and toggle label.

Navigation Sidebar – contains navigation links.

Main Content – contains the welcome message and description.

Footer – spans across the bottom.

Added an input checkbox for the dark mode toggle and styled it so that when it is checked, it updates the CSS variables to switch theme colors.

In styles.css, I:

Defined CSS variables for colors in :root.

Styled the header with display: flex and justify-content: space-between so the title is on the left and the toggle label is on the right.

Increased the font size of the header title and dark mode label for better visibility.

Styled the sidebar with padding and a light background for the default theme.

Applied a darker background and light text colors when dark mode is active (using the :checked selector).

Once styling was done, I opened the project in the browser to test the light/dark mode toggle.

Navigated to the proper Experiment-3 folder in terminal, added all changes, committed them, and pushed to my Git repository.

Later, I also added and pushed this LEARNINGS file.
