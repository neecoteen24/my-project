Experiment 2 was about creating a Banking UI with Deposit/Withdrawal Buttons and Balance Display.

I tried to design a visually appealing and responsive banking interface using HTML/CSS.

Whats in the UI?
A simple yet appealing Banking UI that contains a balance section and under it there are two buttons - Deposit and Withdraw.
It is centered on the page with proper spacing and alignment to look clean and professional.
It is not responsive yet.

What procedures I have taken?
Firstly, I have created a html file that consists of a "outer-container" div and an "inner-container" div.
Inside these created another div tag named balance that displays the balance of the account.
Under it i have created to buttons namely Deposit and Withdraw.

Then, i have created a css file to add styling to different selectors, starting from the outer-container
