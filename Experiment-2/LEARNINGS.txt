Experiment 2 was about creating a Banking UI with Deposit/Withdrawal Buttons and Balance Display.

I tried to design a visually appealing and responsive banking interface using HTML/CSS.

Whats in the UI?

-A simple yet appealing Banking UI that contains a balance section and under it there are two buttons - Deposit and Withdraw.
-It is centered on the page with proper spacing and alignment to look clean and professional.
It is not responsive yet.

What procedures I have taken?

-Firstly, I have created a html file that consists of a "outer-container" div and an "inner-container" div.
Inside these created another div tag named balance that displays the balance of the account.
Under it i have created to buttons namely Deposit and Withdraw.

-Then, i have created a css file, linked it to html file and added styling to different selectors, starting from the outer-container that has a light color, also added display-flex property to activate the flexbox layout property.
Then the inner-container that has borders curved, implemented that with border-radius also then added some padding and margin to introduce spacing to the selectors.
Added colors to the Withdraw: red and Deposit:green button and then aligned them to center and added padding to them.
Set their respective background-colors and colors as white, as per the given output.

-After carrying out the changes, ive navigated to proper Experiment-2 file in terminal, added, committed and pushed the changes to my git repository.

-Also added and pushed this LEARNINGS file later.
