## Git Authentication Setup

### Having trouble pushing code? 

If you're unable to authenticate your SSH keys or push code to GitHub, we have guides to help:

ðŸ“– **[Complete SSH Setup Guide](./SSH_SETUP.md)** - Detailed step-by-step instructions

âš¡ **[Quick SSH Reference](./QUICK_SSH_REFERENCE.md)** - Fast command reference card

These guides cover:
- Generating SSH keys for your new device
- Adding SSH keys to GitHub
- Switching from HTTPS to SSH authentication
- Troubleshooting common SSH issues
- Quick reference commands

### Quick Fix

If you need to push code immediately and SSH isn't working:

1. **Using HTTPS (temporary solution):**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/neecoteen24/my-project.git
   git push
   ```
   You'll be prompted for your GitHub username and personal access token.

2. **For long-term solution:** Follow the [SSH Setup Guide](./SSH_SETUP.md)
